🧠 AI Support Agent

Structured Output · LangGraph · FastAPI · Streamlit

A production-grade AI support agent built using LangGraph for stateful orchestration, strict structured outputs with Pydantic, and a clean frontend–backend architecture.

This project demonstrates how to design deterministic, testable, and modular AI agents suitable for real-world systems.

✨ Features

✅ LangGraph-based stateful agent orchestration

✅ Strict structured outputs using Pydantic schemas

✅ Deterministic intent & severity classification

✅ Modular prompt-as-logic design

✅ Clean separation of state, logic, prompts, and transport layers

✅ FastAPI backend

✅ Streamlit frontend

✅ Pytest + Ruff enabled (production-ready quality)
